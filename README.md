In this project there is a server side that will constitute an anomaly detector based on statistics.

The client will be able to upload to the server a CSV file, update parameters of the algorithm and receive a report of detected anomalies.
In addition the customer will be able to enter where the actual anomalies occurred and get an analysis of the accuracy of the algorithm on the data
Who sent.
